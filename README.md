# Supervised-Unsupervised-Data-Mining
Data Mining Project

This Project was devided into two tasks
1. Supervised Data mining
  To refer to Dataset refer to EireJet.csv
  To refer to code refer to code1_nagarathna_sali.py
2. UnSupervised Data Mining
  To refer to Dataset refer to EireJet.csv
  To refer to code refer to Code 2_Nagarathna_Sali.py
  To refer to t-SNE VIZ1_Nagarathna_Sali.html, VIZ2_NagarathnaSali.html, VIZ3_1_Nagarathna_Sali.html, VIZ3_2_Nagarathna_sali.html and VIZ5_Nagarathna_sali.html
  
To refer to report analysis of both the task refer to Report_Nagarathna_sali.pdf

Below is the detailed description about both tasks and datsets used.
1. Supervised Data mining
Task: 
Task is to construct a classification model in Python that can predict passengersâ€™ satisfaction
with the EireJet Airlines . Classification models used are random forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boost models, and 
finally pick the best performing model that can be used by EireJet to use in the real-world

About Dataset
Each row in EireJet.csv corresponds to a passenger who travelled with EireJet Airlines. 
Relevant information about this dataset can be found in Appendix1.

2. UnSupervised Data Mining
Task
Task is to find natural clusters in the given dataset using t-SNE and clustering algorithms in Python. The 
goal is to interpret these clusters to see if appropriate labels can be assigned to them.

About Dataset
Each row in EireStay.csv corresponds to a booking at EireStay Resort. Relevant information 
about this dataset can be found in Appendix 2.
